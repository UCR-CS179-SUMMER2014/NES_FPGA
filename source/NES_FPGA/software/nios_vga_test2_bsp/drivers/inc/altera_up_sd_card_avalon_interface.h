 * 
 * Inputs:
 *      name - a file name including a directory, relative to the root directory
 *      create - a flag set to true to create a file if it does not already exist
 * Output:
 *      An index to the file record assigned to the specified file. -1 is returned if the file could not be opened.

/* This function sets up a search algorithm to go through a given directory looking for files.
 * If the search directory is valid, then the function searches for the first file it finds.
 * Inputs:
 *		directory_to_search_through - name of the directory to search through
 *		file_name - an array to store a name of the file found. Must be 13 bytes long (12 bytes for file name and 1 byte of NULL termination).
 * Outputs:
 *		0 - success
 *		1 - invalid directory
 *		2 - No card or incorrect card format.
 *
 * To specify a directory give the name in a format consistent with the following regular expression:
 * [{[valid_chars]+}/]*.
 * 
 * In other words, give a path name starting at the root directory, where each directory name is followed by a '/'.
 * Then, append a '.' to the directory name. Examples:
 * "." - look through the root directory
 * "first/." - look through a directory named "first" that is located in the root directory.
 * "first/sub/." - look through a directory named "sub", that is located within the subdirectory named "first". "first" is located in the root directory.
 * Invalid examples include:
 * "/.", "/////." - this is not the root directory.
 * "/first/." - the first character may not be a '/'.

 * Outputs:
 *		-1 - end of directory.
 *		0 - success
 *		2 - No card or incorrect card format.
 *		4 - find_first has not been called successfully.
